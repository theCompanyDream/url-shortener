# URL Shortener

A rest service that that shortens urls for you.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker-Compose
- Make

## Directions

Everything is in docker to make testing pretty seamless so just run `make`.

## Future

I want to store a static list of slug names, or make permanent stulgs I want to use rethinkdb to do this. There is a nice ruby port and I think this would be the perfect project to use Ruby.
